This repo investigates a graph-constrained changepoint model with two
states and four changes, multi-modal regression, which detects peak
summits.

** 5 Feb 2020

Does forward and backward multi-modal regression model have same cost?
No, it is not symmetric! But simpler up-down constrained model is.
